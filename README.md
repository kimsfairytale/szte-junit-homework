### Exercise

Look into the `org.junittraining.exercise` packages. 

1. Find the `IPAddressCalculations` interface and check its Javadoc
2. Plan the tests for this interface. Consider as many usecases and patterns with different inputs as possible to achieve a complete coverage.
3. Implement the test according to your plans
4. Execute the tests on the dummy implementation `IPAddressCalculationsHorribleImpl`
5. Summarize the issues you have found with your tests
6. Repoint your tests to execute on the yet empty `IPAddressCalculationsImpl` implementation
7. Start the implementation in this class, and meanwhile execute your tests repeatedly to see how you are progressing. 
8. You are done if all your tests pass.
